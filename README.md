## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

### Getting Started

Create a vercel account and start a new postgres database. Copy and past all the database-related secrets into the .env file.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Push the code and deploy directly on vercel, or run locally by doing

```
npm run dev
```
